## Interesting Trends in the Data
###  
### Change in Trip Durations as Months Change

##### As the months get colder, the average trip durations get longer. This is because the colder months in L.A. are much more comfortable to exercise in the warmer ones.

### Change in Pass Types Over as Months Change

##### It is immediately clear that a very low percentage of the monthly riders are staff members. The graph also reveals that the percentage of people using flex passes remains fairly constant, and small, as the months change. The interesting data comes from the walk-up vs. monthly pass data. Monthly passes are more popular than walk-ups in every single month, but the difference is exagerated in the month of July. This is most likely because many students in L.A. are on vacation for that month and are therefore more likely to ride bikes around the city. This makes it cheaper for them to buy a monthly pass than pay extra every time they take out a bike.

### Change in Number of Riders as Months Change

##### *The month of July is left off of the graph because there was not enough data to compare the monthly ridership to other months.* The graph shows a steady decrease in monthly ridership over the period of time from August to December, then it begins to increase again in March. This is directly correlated with the change in temperature in Los Angeles. Although it is still fairly temperate relative to other states in the Winter, the city's denizens are much less likely to ride a bike outside because it is cold for them.
